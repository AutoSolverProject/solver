Authors: Ofer Ravid, Tomer Michael.

This project includes files taken from course "Mathematical Logic for Programming Oriented Students".
These files were authored for the exercises in that course by Yannai Gonczarowski and Noam Nisan,
with implementations by Ofer, and we were given permission to use in this project.
These files are located in the folders: first_order_logic and propositional_logic.

- sat_solver.py - mainly authored by Tomer.
- smt_solver.py - mainly authored by Ofer.
- lp_theory_solver - unfinished implementation for part 3 of the project, authored by Ofer.
- cnf_syntax.py - authored by Tomer.
- disjoint_set_tree.py - authored by Ofer.
- utils.formula_utils.py - authored by Tomer.
- utils.normal_forms.py - authored by Ofer.
- utils.test_utils.py - authored by Tomer.
- naive_lp_solver - authored by Ofer, solving an alternate part 3, this include:
    - naive_lp_solver.cpp
    - Makefile
